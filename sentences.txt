Lady, all the troubles are my fright, I disgust you
Feel the power you cut the truth into you
Why do you think I did not on this rely
I could kiss you with lines of escape in my mouth
Please let me bring back these gifts of mine to the woman
Stars shined on my back as I slept and knew you
You didn't leave it all
You made an even call
My belly released the stars and tears between the scars
Below this we'll end here until the end of time
Beyond the moment that ends our bondage
I am your failed husband contender
I'm your loan shark of bliss
This dream you've ridden on turns your world to explosions
I need to be alone to heal this bleeding stone
Now, smell the rain of london, it still insists
That we beg for our purity
As if we are pure in the reign of our contentment
As if i can think of this no more
Time takes care of the wound so I can believe
You had so much to give you thought I couldn't see
Gifts for boot heels to crush Promises deceived
I had to send it away to bring us back again
Your eyes and body brighten / Silent waters, deep
Your precious daughter in the other room, asleep
A kiss "Goodnight" from every stranger that I meet
I had to send it away to bring us back again
Morning theft / Unpretender left / Ungrateful
True self is what brought you here, to me
A place where we can accept this love
Friendship battered down by useless history Unexamined failure
But what am I still to you / Some thief who stole from you?
Or, some fool drama queen whose chances were few?
That brings us to who we need / A place where we can save
A heart that beats as both siphon and reservoir
You're a woman, I'm a calf
You're a window, I'm a knife
We come together making chance in the starlight
Meet me tomorrow night or any day you want
I have no right to wonder just how, or when
You know the meaning fits There's no relief in this
I miss my beautiful friend
I have to send it away to bring her back again
Rilkean heart I looked for you
To give me transcendent experiences
To transport me out of self and aloneness
And alienation into a sense of
One-ness and connection ecstatic and magical
I became a junkie for it
I came looking for the next high and I'm sorry
I've been putting the search on the wrong place
I understand that you're confused Feeling overwhelmed
Well that's a feeling state from then
The reality, with cleaning up my emotion of life
And I'm getting in touch with myself
I'm beginning to ground myself
In my own sense of being as an entity
One entity on the planet
Becoming truly self-reliant and become connected
With something beyond me
That is where I have to go I'm so sorry
I've been putting the search on the wrong place
You're lost and don't know what to do
But that's not all of you
That's your reality today
And that is all okay
I understand that you're confused, feeling overwhelmed
Well that's a feeling state from then The reality
You're lost and don't know what to do
But it's not all of you
That's the reality today
And now it's all okay
I understand that you're confused,
Feeling overwhelmed
Well that's a feeling state from then The reality
My eyes are A baptism
Oh I am filth
And sing her into my thoughts
Oh phantom elusive thing oh
All flowers in time bend towards the sun
I know you say that there's no-one for you
But here is one
All flowers in time bend towards the sun
I know you say that there's no-one for you
But here is one, here is one, here is one
One that can never be known
Either all drunk with the world at her feet
Or sober with no place to go
Keep it going in me, wicked traveler
Fading farther from me with your face in my window glow
Oh, when will you weep for me? Sweet willow
It's ok to be angry but not to hurt me
Your happiness, yes, yes, yes
Darling, darling
Bloom inside, my beautiful flower
If you feel your blood moving under your skin
Then let it kiss every inch of you
Let the friction of its rushing through your riverbed
Arise like applause in your breast
And sparkle like kisses upon your belly
Close your eyes and fly
Stretch your legs and sing
Because inside you the sea is swelling in love with the moon
No such things as self defense or bondage
Or regret from the past, the ocean only lives and creates and flows
But always in love with the moon
Speak out to me
My beautiful sparrow
In the morning you fly over a city
Of lunatics walking in pain and waiting for betrayal
All you know is the wind
The rhythm of the fragrance of the world
Only, you can sing me awake
Sing it to me with the smell of your back
Sing it to me with the heat of your lips
Kiss me where you want and the song is all I can hear
Inside you the sea is swelling over
Spilling over my head
And I stay submerged
Waiting for your rose to open to me
And your song to sink into my skin
I know you are a woman by the way you burn below.
I'll tell you secrets so good, you'll never tell a soul.
Come closer, that bonfire holds his life like stones
My years, my life unknown.
Diamonds from he pavement
Where the broken glass had been.
Just like this troubles that I'm leaving to the wind.
Like sapphires in boxcars speeding towards the end.
Like thieves, my bad luck grows.
Jewel box of sadness, bring to catch your tear
Crystallize illusion shine, forgot I'm here
Jewel box of sadness, bring to catch your tear
Oh, you left some stars in my belly.
Star crossed child's love on the bands of wedding golds
Silver studs of promise hide in the red crushed velvet folds.
Inaction, intention, like emeralds I stole.
My speech of custom gold.
I think I ought to know.
Jewel box of sadness, bring to catch your tear
Crystallize illusion shine, forgot I'm here
Jewel box of sadness, bring to catch your tear
Oh, you left some stars in my belly.
You left some stars in my belly.
You left some stars in my belly.
